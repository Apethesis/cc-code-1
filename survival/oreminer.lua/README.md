OreMiner program will hunt down ores and mine until it's inventory is full, then it will broadcast it's position every minute until the turtles are collected
It requires 3 programs:
* The digging turtle. Requires a modem and pickaxe.
* The scanning turtle. Requires a modem and a geoscanner (Advanced Peripherals)
* The receiver station. Requires a 2x3 monitor and a modem.

The two turtles use the skyrtle library to have positions even when GPS is not available.
